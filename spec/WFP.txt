Abstract
--------
The *WebSockets Frontend Protocol* (*WFP*) is a transport layer protocol
for exchanging messages between Browsers and the Frontend WebSockets
Server implemented by {webrocket}.

Language
--------
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119, RFC 2119>>.

Goals
-----
The purpose of the protocol is to allow for bidirectional, evented
communication between Browsers and Frontend WebSockets Server over
the <<WSP, WebSockets Protocol>> using the <<WSA, HTML5 WebSockets API>>.

Generalized architecture
------------------------
The Frontend WebSockets Server handles communication with the Clients
(Browsers) over the <<WSP, HTML5's WebSockets Protocol>>. Its endpoint
is combined up of a number of parts:

	[scheme]://[host]:[port]/[version]/[vhost]

[horizontal]
'scheme'::
	Will be 'ws' for a normal connection and 'wss' for a secure.

'host'::
	There is bound the server.

'port'::
	The port to connect to.

'version'::
	The Frontend WebSockets Protocol version.

'vhost'::
	The virtual host to connect to.

Events
~~~~~~
The protocol implemented by {webrocket} defines two kinds of events: 
<<client-events, 'client'>> and <<server-events, 'server'>> specific.

[[client-events]]
Client Events
-------------
Two groups of 'client' specific events can be distinguished:

'System events'::
		Events triggered automatically by the Frontend WebSockets
		Server. System event names MUST be prefixed with double
		underscore (eg. '__connected').

'Custom events'::
		User-defined events triggered by Backend Applications or other
		connected Clients.

All client event messages MUST have the following <<JSON, JSON>>-encoded
payload format:

[source,js]
------
{		
    "eventName": {
        // ... parameters ...
    }
}
------

Event names as well as parameter keys SHOULD be defined as camel-cased
strings, to keep compliance with the JavaScript coding style guidelines.

IMPORTANT: The 'event-name' MUST be prefixed with double underscore for
	the 'system' events, and SHALL NOT use such prefix for the 'custom'
	user-defined events.

Connection established
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the connection is successfully established the Server sends an event
to confirm that situation with the Client. Message's payload MUST contain
unique identifier of the current session.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__connected": {
        "sid": "session-id"
    }
}
-----

.Parameters

[horizontal]
'sid' [`string`]::
	An unique identifier of the current session.

[[client-succ-auth]]
Successfull authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connected Client has been successfully <<server-auth,authenticated>>
the Server sends an event to confirm that situation. Message's payload
MUST contain name of the authenticated user and MAY contain additional
information about the authenticated session.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__authenticated": {
        "user": "joe"
        // ...
    }
}
-----

.Parameters

[horizontal]
'user' [`string`]::
	Name of the authenticated user.

[[client-confirm-sub]]
Confirmed subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connected Client has successfully <<server-subscribe,subscribed>>
to the specified channel the Server sends an event to confirm that
situation. Message's payload MUST contain the name of the subscribed
channel.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__subscribed": {
        "channel": "chat"
    }
}
-----

.Parameters

[horizontal]
'channel' [`string`]::
	The name of the subscribed channel.

[[client-confirm-priv-sub]]
Private channel subscription
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If subscribed channel is a 'Private Channel' then message's payload MAY
additionaly contain information about the Client permissions.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__subscribed": {
        "channel": "chat",
        "permission": 1
    }
}
-----

.Parameters

[horizontal]
'channel' [`string`]::
	Name of the subscribed channel.

'permission' [`int`]::
	The numeric value of the client permissions.

.Permissions
Returned permission code MUST be logical disjunction of one or more
possible values:

[horizontal]
*`1`* (READ)::
	Read-only access.

*`2`* (WRITE)::
	Write-only access.

*`4`* (OP)::
	Special right, the channel operator.

TODO: reference to access control document

[[client-confirm-presence-sub]]
Presence channel subscription
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 'Presence channel' is a special kind of channel, which keeps track of
all Clients subscribed on it and shares that information across all other
subscribers. In that case, the message's payload MUST contain list of
subscribers' records with session identifier. The subscribers' records
MAY additionally contain custom data about related with particular
subscriber.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__subscribed": {
        "channel": "chat",
        "subscribers": [
            {
                "sid": "session-id",
                "data": {
                    // ... custom information ...
                }
