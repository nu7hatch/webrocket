WEBROCKET - Real-time Web Broker
================================

NOTE: This is not the official repository, it has been moved to the
http://github.com/webrocket/webrocket organization's repo!

WebRocket is a hybrid of MQ and WebSockets server with great support for
horizontal scalability. WebRocket is very fast and easy to use from both

will finally make bidirectional Web easy for everyone.
