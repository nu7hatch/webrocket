Installation
============

To install WebRocket you need the following tools and dependecies:

Latest Go compiler
------------------
WebRocket is written in the Go programming language. If you don't have the Go
compiler installed yet, follow this installation guide: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

IMPORTANT: WebRocket has to be built against the latest weekly release!

So far, WebRocket is using a bunch of unreleased features and attempts to
keep up with Go's development, thats why you should remember to clone a *head
version* or the latest *weakly release*:

To get and build a head version of the compiler use the following command:

	$ hg clone https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go
	$ cd go/src
	$ ./all.bash

When the build succeeds you need to add few environment variables to your
'~/.bashrc' (or other shell configuration file):

	export GOROOT=/path/to/go
	export GOOS=os-name # darwin, linux, freebsd...
	export GOARCH=arch-name # amd64 or i386
	export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin
	export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
	
If you have any other doubts or problems please follow the instructions
in Go's documentation.

Dependencies
------------
WebRocket depends on few external libraries which have to be installed
in your system before you build it.

kyoto-cabinet (>= 1.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Kyoto Cabinet hash table library. This library should be available
in your package manager's repository in most operating systems.

.Debian
	$ TODO ...

.Arch Linux
	$ yaourt -S kyoto-cabinet // or install it manually from AUR

.Brew
	$ brew install kyoto-cabinet

Development dependencies
------------------------
If you want to work on WebRocket development, you need to install a
few additional dependencies.

asciidoc
~~~~~~~~
Documentation and man pages generator.

TIP: If you're an OSX user, in order to make the 'asciidoc' work
properly you have to register the installed docbook.

	$ brew install docbook asciidoc
	$ sudo docbook-register

On any other Linux/Unix distribution it's enough to just install deps
with your favorite package manager:

.Debian
	$ apt-get install docbook asciidoc

.Arch Linux
	$ pacman -S asciidoc

Building WebRocket
------------------
Once you have the Go compiler and all dependencies installed, we can move
to building our WebRocket installation. Building WebRocket is very easy and
shouldn't cause too many problems. After you clone the repository, just use
the standard 'make' targets to build and install:

	$ git clone git://github.com/nu7hatch/webrocket.git
	$ cd webrocket
	$ git submodule init && git submodule update
	$ gomake
	$ gomake check # it's a good idea to run tests

Documentation and Manual pages
------------------------------
If you are working on the documentation or want to simply generate man pages
and other docs, use the following 'make' targets

	$ make man
	
...generates man pages and its html versions in the 'docs/' directory.

	$ make papers

...generates html versions of all other documents (README, INSTALL, etc.).

Troubleshooting
---------------
You may encounter a situation when WebRocket fails to build due to using
a stale version of the Go compiler and fails again due to compiler version
mismatch after you update it to the latest version. In this case you should
cleanup the project workspace by running the 'clean' target:

	$ make clean

Usage
-----
Now all the WebRocket tools should be available in your system. Check
the manual entries for each of them to get information about their usage.
List of available manual entries:

* link:docs/webrocket-ctl.1.html[*webrocket-ctl*(1)]
* link:docs/webrocket-monitor.1.html[*webrocket-monitor*(1)]
