Contributing to WebRocket
=========================

WebRocket is a collaborative project and we encourage contributions
from anyone and everyone. If you want to contribute in the way that will
help us most, we recommend fixing reported bugs and implementing the
feature ideas in 'TODO'. However, if you think of new features to add,
please suggest them too -- we might like your idea.

If you don't feel up to hacking WebRocket, there are many other ways to
help. You can answer questions on the mailing lists, write documentation
and examples, find and report bugs, contribute to the WebRocket web pages,
or develop a package that works with WebRocket.

Coding standards
----------------

.Formatting

Go is simple and straightforward enough to avoid code mess. Although,
you should always check your code formating with 'gofmt' tool.

.Testing

If you implemented new feature, then appropriate tests should be
added to prove its proper functionality. Remember to always check if
all tests are passing before you submit your changes. Use `make check`
command to run our test suite. 

.Documentation

All new types and functions added to the code should be documented.
Good documentation makes our and your life much esier.

Submitting Patches
------------------
Every patch must have several pieces of information before we
can properly evaluate it.

When you have all these pieces, bundle them up and send us a pull request.
If your patch is not complete and you think it needs more discussion,
don't hesitate to create an issue or discuss on existing one. If you
revise your patch, send it as a followup to the initial topic.

.Description

For bug fixes, a description of the bug and how your patch fixes thisbug.
For new features, a description of the feature and your implementation.

.ChangeLog

A ChangeLog entry as plaintext (separate from the patch).

See the various ChangeLog files for format and content. Note that,
unlike some other projects, we do require ChangeLogs also for
documentation, i.e. txt files in the 'docs' directory.

.The patch itself

Please, reread your patch's diff before you submit it. Use `git diff` command
to review it. 

.Do not mix changes

If you send several unrelated changes together, we will ask you to
separate them so we can consider each of the changes by itself.

.Do not make formatting changes

Making cosmetic formatting changes (indentation, etc) makes it harder
to see what you have really changed.
